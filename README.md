# Turtle_Artworks

This repository showcases creative programming using Python’s built-in Turtle graphics module. Each file in this project demonstrates how simple geometric logic and loops can be used to generate beautiful patterns, artistic visuals, and recursive designs.

In this project, we:

- Use Turtle’s drawing API to create mandalas, spirals, stars, and symmetric patterns
- Apply programming fundamentals like loops, angles, recursion, and color control
- Explore concepts like symmetry, animation, and incremental rotation
- Build visual art through pure Python logic — no image libraries required
- Focus on clean, readable code that’s ideal for learning or teaching graphics programming

This repo is ideal for those looking to:

- Learn Python through fun, visual projects
- Practice loops, functions, and coordinate geometry in a creative way
- Build a visually impressive Python portfolio without advanced libraries
- Explore recursion and logic behind graphical art
- Understand the relationship between math and design
